    <p>This will test notifications to Telegram using above team, chatId and token settings <b>exclusively</b>, so <u>any missing information will make the test fail</u>.</p>
	<p>You can test a specific setup here, but it is recommended you configure common parameters in Jenkins general configuration, so you won't have to repeat/update any job configuration if your usual token, chatId or team name changes.</p>
